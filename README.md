# X509Validation
A python implementation of the X.509v3 certificate path validation algorithm, 
built on top of pyca's 'cryptography' package.

This is a work in progress. I'm currently trying to figure out how to extend cryptography (https://github.com/pyca/cryptography) to provide certificate signature verification functionality.
